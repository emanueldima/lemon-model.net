### Lemon Generator

Lemon Source incorporates the lemon generator that extends OWL and RDFS ontologies by automatically applying the following analysis

* Tokenization
* Lemmatization
* Part-of-speech detection
* Phrase analysis (parsing)

Lemon Source integrates this tool, however if you may directly generate lexica [here](http://monnet01.sindice.net:8080/generate).
